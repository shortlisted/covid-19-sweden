# About

This is the data published on the covid-19 pandemic by Folkhälsomyndigheten (Public Health Agency of Sweden) reformatted from excel to a .csv format.

~~Data is published daily at 14:00 CET.~~

**Update (21/9):** The FHM changed the statistics reporting on 14/9 to only update stats on Tue-Fri.

The agency started publishing this data on april 3.

Will commit the daily updates to this repo, since the agency doesn't provide a CSV version of this data.
